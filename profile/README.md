## Research and Infrastructure Support (RISE) 

We support researchers in the humanities and social sciences at the University of Basel in the conception of computer-based research, the creation, analysis and user-oriented presentation of digital data, as well as in sustainable and open methods of data dissemination.

Our team is the first point of contact for the conception of projects working with digital methods and data. We provide support for setting up data management plans, and we pilote, plan and accompany processes of data and software development, or assist in finding suitable partners for such tasks.
