# Research and Infrastructure Support (RISE)

We [support](https://rise.unibas.ch/en/services/) researchers in the humanities and social sciences at the University of Basel in the conception of computer-based research, the creation, analysis and user-oriented presentation of digital data, as well as in sustainable and open methods of data dissemination.

Our [team](https://rise.unibas.ch/en/team/) is the first point of contact for the conception of projects working with digital methods and data. We provide support for setting up data management plans, and we pilote, plan and accompany processes of data and software development, or assist in finding suitable partners for such tasks.

The RISE team has a portfolio of experience with editions, corpora and other data types from the humanities and social sciences. It has expertise in the areas of data modelling and visualisation, digitisation, data refinement (markup, transcription, annotation, geo referencing etc.), metadata (standards, formats, enrichment), databases and repositories, real-time and network analyses, quantitative analysis for text, image, audio and video, standardisation, archiving, citation and distribution. We provide support in the FAIRification of research data (making them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and in their linkage and sustainable integration into research data infrastructures.
